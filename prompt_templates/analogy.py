ANALOGY_DESCRIPTION = """
Analogy resolution is a task where the goal is to identify the relationship between two given items and apply that same 
relationship to a new pair of items. Here, the task involves completing analogies of the form "If A is like B, then C is like..." 
where the objective is to find the missing item that best completes the analogy with B based on the relationship identified between A and C. 
This requires understanding and applying relational patterns, often involving linguistic, conceptual, or functional similarities.
