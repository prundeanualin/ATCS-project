It is the colloquial simplicity of baby. Therefore, the answer is infant.', 'conditional': 'The analogy between the terms car and auto and that of infant and baby would illustrate how language evolves to incorporate common usage and simplification. The term car would be a ubiquitous descriptor for automobiles, or auto in short, to encompass a wide range of motor-equipped, wheeled vehicles used for transportation. It would be deeply ingrained in everyday language, while auto would be a more formal and technical term used in professional or academic contexts. Car and auto therefore would imply a synonym relationship, which can also be observed between baby and infant. Baby would be a term laden with warmth and familiarity, invoking a sense of everyday tenderness and care for early childhood. On the other hand, infant would represent a more clinical or scientific terminology for a human being at their early stages of growth and maturity, for example in terms of bio-physical stages, consciousness and mentality, and could be understood as a colloquial simplicity of baby. Therefore, the answer is infant.'}\n",

Similarly, indolent is synonyms of lazy. Therefore, the answer is indolent', 'short': 'Soon and immediate share a similar relationship, implying that something is about to happen in the near future. Similarly, lazy and indolent both describe a lack of motivation or effort to engage in activities, indicating the same synnonym relationship between two terms. Therefore, the answer is indolent.', 'long': ' Immediate denotes something happening without any delay, indicating an action or occurrence that takes place right away. Meanwhile, soon suggests a shorter timeframe before an event occurs, indicating that it will happen in the near future, though not necessarily immediately. Following the same reasoning, the relationship between lazy and indolent is one of similarity in meaning and connotation as in soon and immediate. Both terms describe a lack of motivation, effort, or energy towards tasks or activities. Lazy is a colloquial term commonly used to describe someone who habitually avoids exerting effort or engaging in productive tasks, often preferring to rest or do nothing instead. On the other hand, indolent is a more formal and less commonly used term that carries the same meaning of a disinclination towards exertion or activity. To sum up, the relationship between lazy and indolent mirrors that of soon and immediate, with lazy representing a less formal counterpart to the more precise term indolent, just as soon signifies a less immediate timeframe compared to the immediacy conveyed by immediate.

Therefore, the answer is indolent.', 'detailed': 'The relationship between soon and immediate lies in the context of time, with both used to describe the immediacy of an event.

Therefore, the answer is indolent.', 'simple': 'The relationship between soon and immediate is about time. Immediate and soon both mean something is about to occur, with a slighly minor contextual nuances, in which soon means something will happen in the near future, but not necessarily right away as implied by immediate. Similarly, lazy and indolent are alike in what they mean. Both describe not wanting to do things. Lazy is a casual word for someone who avoids work and prefers to rest. Indolent is a fancier, less common word with the same meaning. So, just as lazy is a simpler version of indolent, soon is less immediate than immediate.
