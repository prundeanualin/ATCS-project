Okay, think of the solar system like a big family, and the sun is like the grandma or grandpa in the middle. The planets, like Earth, Mars, and Jupiter, are like the kids spinning around them. Now, in an atom, it's a bit like a tiny family too. The nucleus is like the grandma or grandpa, and the electrons are like the little kids spinning around them. Therefore, the answer is electron.

heat transfer,water flow,kettle,bucket,,science
Imagine you have a big container for water called a bucket. It's like a special metal tool that keeps water in one place when you pour it in. Now, think about a kettle. It's also a metal thing, but instead of water, it holds heat. When you put heat into it, it keeps it all in one place, just like a bucket does with water. Therefore, the answer is kettle.

heat transfer,water flow,cooling,emptying,,science
Imagine you have a cup full of water, and when you pour out the water, the cup becomes empty. That's what "emptying" means—it's when something is getting rid of what's inside. Now, think about heat. When something cools down, it's like it's getting rid of heat, just like when you pour out water, you're getting rid of it from the cup. Therefore, the answer is cooling.

heat transfer,water flow,thermodynamics,hydrodynamics,,science

Now, for sounds, imagine you're in a room and there's a wall. When sounds reach the wall, they don't go through it; the wall stops them. Therefore, just like the shore stops waves, the wall stops sounds. Therefore, the answer is wall.

sounds,waves,echoes,reflects,,science
Let's imagine you're throwing a ball against a wall. When the ball hits the wall, it bounces back to you, right? That's like what waves do when they hit something and bounce back, it's called reflection. Now, for sounds, when they hit something, they bounce back too, but we call it echoing instead of reflecting. Therefore, just like a ball reflects off a wall, sounds bounce back, or echo, off surfaces. Therefore, the answer is echoes.

sounds,waves,quiet,calm,,science
Think about when you're at the beach and the water is very still with no waves at all. We call that calm, right? It's like everything is peaceful and quiet on the surface of the water.

And the different kinds of dogs they make, like poodles or bulldogs, are called breeds. Now, for natural selection, it's like when animals in the wild have certain traits that help them survive, like long necks for reaching food. Over time, those traits become more common, and eventually, new types of animals, like giraffes, emerge. These new types are called species. Therefore, just as breeds come from artificial selection, species come from natural selection. Therefore, the answer is species.

natural selection,artificial selection,competition,selection,,science
